1. Configuration YAML file - just like the runtime agent
2. REST API
3. Metrics and data exposed by the profiler:

       * Basic profiler functionality - memory, CPU, advice GC
       * List of apps, list of flows per app
       * List of thread pools, their relationship to the flow (i.e. which flows use which thread pools),
         total threads, allocated threads, pool exhausted action
       * Number of threads - total / per app / per flow / per SEDA queue
       * Time the thread spends in flow / message processor - max/min/average/spread
       * Object stores and number of objects (low priority)
       * Response time (for sync flows) or processing time (for async flows) - max/min/average/spread

4. IntelliJ plugin
